[Unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/) provides NPM-based CDN links. The above link will always point to the latest release on NPM. You can also use a specific version/tag via URLs like `https://unpkg.com/vuex@2.0.0`.

Include `vuex` after Vue and it will install itself automatically:

```html
<script src="/path/to/vue.js"></script>
<script src="/path/to/vuex.js"></script>
```

<script src="https://unpkg.com/vuex@next"></script>
```
